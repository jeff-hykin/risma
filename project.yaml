    abstract: 'Motivated by the intuitive understanding humans have about the space of possible interactions, and the ease with which they can generalize this understanding to previously unseen scenes, we develop an approach for learning ‘visual affordances’. Given an input image of a scene, we infer a distribution over plausible future states that can be achieved via interactions with it. To allow predicting diverse plausible futures, we discretize the space of continuous images with a VQ-VAE and use a Transformer-based model to learn a conditional distribution in the latent embedding space. We show that these models can be trained using large-scale and diverse passive data, and that the learned models exhibit compositional generalization to diverse objects beyond the training distribution. We evaluate the quality and diversity of the generations, and demonstrate how the trained affordance model can be used for guiding exploration during visual goal-conditioned policy learning in robotic manipulation.'

    abstract: 'Goal imagination in robotics is an emerging concept and involves the capability to automatically generate realistic goals, which, in turn, requires the assessment of the feasibility of transitioning from the current conditions of an initial scene to the desired goal state. Existing research has explored the utilization of diverse image-generative models to create images depicting potential goal states based on the current state and instructions. In this paper, we illustrate the limitations of current state-of-the-art image generative models in accurately assessing the feasibility of specific actions in particular situations. Consequently, we present how integrating large language models, which possess profound knowledge of real-world objects and affordances, can enhance the performance of image-generative models in discerning plausible from implausible actions and simulating the outcomes of actions in a given context. This will be a step towards achieving the pragmatic goal of imagination in robotics.'

    abstract: '     In this paper we explore the richness of information captured by the latent space of a vision-based generative model. The model combines unsupervised generative learning with a task-based performance predictor to learn and to exploit task-relevant object affordances given visual observations from a reaching task, involving a scenario and a stick-like tool. While the learned embedding of the generative model captures factors of variation in 3D tool geometry (e.g. length, width, and shape), the performance predictor identifies sub-manifolds of the embedding that correlate with task success. Within a variety of scenarios, we demonstrate that traversing the latent space via backpropagation from the performance predictor allows us to imagine tools appropriate for the task at hand. Our results indicate that affordances-like the utility for reaching-are encoded along smooth trajectories in latent space. Accessing these emergent affordances by considering only high-level performance criteria (such as task success) enables an agent to manipulate tool geometries in a targeted and deliberate way. '
